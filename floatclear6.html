<h2>Without Clearfix</h2>

<p>This image is floated to the right. It is also taller than the element containing it, so it overflows outside of its container:</p>

<div>

    <img class="img1" src="https://cdn.britannica.com/55/2155-050-604F5A4A/lion.jpg" alt="lion"
    width="170" height="170">
    The lion is a creature that belongs to the animal kingdom. Forests or jungles are the natural habitats of lions. The animal is called the ‘King of the Jungle’ because of its strength and power. The lion is a carnivore that means that it eats the flesh of other animals.</p>  
</div>
<h2 style="clear: right">with new modern clearfix</h2>
<p>Add the clearfix hack to the containing element, to fix this problem:</p>
<div class="clearfix">
